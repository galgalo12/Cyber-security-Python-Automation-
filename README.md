
# 🔍 Regex-Based Threat Hunting & Log Analysis Script

## 📌 Overview
This Python script demonstrates how **regular expressions** can be applied in **cybersecurity threat hunting** and **SOC investigations**. It analyzes text and log data to identify common **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)** and performs basic **IP reputation analysis**.

## 🧠 Summary
- Detects **hexadecimal malware signatures** from text inputs  
- Identifies **device IDs** that match a specific pattern (`r15*`)  
- Extracts **IP address patterns** from log data  
- Flags IPs as **malicious or clean** based on a predefined list  
- Includes an **interactive investigation mode** with timestamps and SOC-style analyst guidance  

## 🎯 Purpose
The script simulates **real-world SOC log analysis and triage workflows**, making it useful for:
- Learning regex-based detection techniques  
- SOC analyst training and labs  
- Demonstrations and portfolio projects  
- Entry-level threat hunting automation
